- README Creation for:   Darrell-DesignSpark / DesignSparkProject 


Started by looking into a software revision control system.
After a few days, it was looking like it was a toss-up between Git and Mercurial.

  GitHub appears to have a larger open source community, but with a more complex tool (Git).

  BitBucket is a smaller community, but with an easier tool (Mercurial). 
  Mercurial is also supposed to be natively supported under MPLAB X.

Found a reference to a Hg-Git mercurial plugin (http://hg-git.github.com/) that is
supposed to allow mercurial to work with GitHub.

So, I setup Git and a GitHub account, so I could test a pure Git installation.
This readme file was created while testing the git installation.

- Installed TortoiseHg on my PC to access readme files and access the tool.

- Next setup a gmail account and GutHub account.

- Installed GIT on my PC to get the basic tool up and running.
     Full installer for official Git for Windows 1.7.8 
     http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/detail?name=Git-1.7.8-preview20111206.exe&can=3&q=official+Git

- Initialized this project repository for the DesignSpark contest.

- Found various setup help sources, including:

   http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/
   http://hg-git.github.com/
   http://kylecordes.com/2008/git-windows-go


To Do List:

- Setup MPLAP X

- After running across TortoiseGit, try to install TortoiseGit (still not compatible with MPLAB X?) from:
    http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/

- Install the Hg-Git mercurial plugin
